The Nautilus DevOps team needs a time check pod created in a specific Kubernetes namespace for logging purposes. Initially, it's for testing, but it may be integrated into an existing cluster later. Here's what's required:


1. Create a pod called time-check in the nautilus namespace. The pod should contain a container named time-check, utilizing the busybox image with the latest tag (specify as busybox:latest).

2. Create a config map named time-config with the data TIME_FREQ=7 in the same namespace.

3. Configure the time-check container to execute the command: while true; do date; sleep $TIME_FREQ;done. Ensure the result is written /opt/sysops/time/time-check.log. Also, add an environmental variable TIME_FREQ in the container, fetching its value from the config map TIME_FREQ key.

4. Create a volume log-volume and mount it at /opt/sysops/time within the container.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.




To create the required pod and config map in the Kubernetes cluster, you can use the following YAML definitions. The pod will be created in the `nautilus` namespace, and it will include the specified configurations.
```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: time-config
  namespace: nautilus
data:
  TIME_FREQ: "7"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: time-check
  namespace: nautilus
spec:
  containers:
    - name: time-check
        image: busybox:latest
        command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do date >> /opt/sysops/time/time-check.log; sleep $TIME_FREQ; done"]
        env:
        - name: TIME_FREQ
        valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
            name: time-config
            key: TIME_FREQ
        volumeMounts:
        - name: log-volume
        mountPath: /opt/sysops/time
    volumes:
    - name: log-volume
      emptyDir: {}
EOF
```

error parsing STDIN: error converting YAML to JSON: yaml: line 9: mapping values are not allowed in this context
Error from server (NotFound): error when creating "STDIN": namespaces "nautilus" not found
The error indicates that the YAML syntax is incorrect, specifically in the indentation of the `name` and `image` fields under the `containers` section. Additionally, it seems that the namespace `nautilus` does not exist yet. You need to create the namespace first before applying the pod and config map definitions.
```bash
kubectl create namespace nautilus
```

error: error parsing STDIN: error converting YAML to JSON: yaml: line 9: mapping values are not allowed in this context
The error indicates that there is a syntax issue in the YAML definition, specifically with the indentation. Hereâ€™s the corrected YAML definition for creating the config map and pod in the `nautilus` namespace:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: time-config
  namespace: nautilus
data:
  TIME_FREQ: "7"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: time-check
  namespace: nautilus
spec:
  containers:
    - name: time-check
      image: busybox:latest
      command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do date >> /opt/sysops/time/time-check.log; sleep $TIME_FREQ; done"]
      env:
      - name: TIME_FREQ
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            name: time-config
            key: TIME_FREQ
      volumeMounts:
      - name: log-volume
        mountPath: /opt/sysops/time
  volumes:
    - name: log-volume
      emptyDir: {}
EOF
```

This command will create both the config map and the pod in the specified namespace. The pod will run indefinitely, logging the current date and time to `/opt/sysops/time/time-check.log` every 7 seconds, as specified by the `TIME_FREQ` environment variable sourced from the config map. The volume `log-volume` is mounted at `/opt/sysops/time` to store the log file.
```bash
kubectl get pods -n nautilus
```
```bash
kubectl get configmap -n nautilus
```
```bash
kubectl logs time-check -n nautilus
```
```bash
kubectl describe pod time-check -n nautilus
```
