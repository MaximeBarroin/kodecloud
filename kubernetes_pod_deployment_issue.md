A junior DevOps team member encountered difficulties deploying a stack on the Kubernetes cluster. The pod fails to start, presenting errors. Let's troubleshoot and rectify the issue promptly.


1. There is a pod named webserver, and the container within it is named httpd-container, its utilizing the httpd:latest image. 


Identify and address the issue to ensure the pod is in the running state and the application is accessible.

To troubleshoot the issue with the `webserver` pod and ensure it is running correctly, follow these steps:
```bash
kubectl get pods webserver -o yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod

The issue with the `webserver` pod is that the `httpd-container` is using an incorrect image name (`httpd:latests` instead of `httpd:latest`). This causes the image pull to fail, leading to the pod being in a `Pending` state.
To fix this, you need to update the pod definition to use the correct image name. You can do this by editing the pod directly or by applying a corrected YAML definition. Hereâ€™s how to update the pod:
```bash
kubectl edit pod webserver
```
This command will open the pod definition in your default text editor. Look for the `httpd-container` section and change the image from `httpd:latests` to `httpd:latest`. After making the change, save and exit the editor.
Alternatively, you can delete the existing pod and recreate it with the corrected image:
```bash
kubectl delete pod webserver
kubectl apply -f webserver-pod.yaml
``` 
when it's corrected, you just have to restart the pod to apply the changes:
```bash
kubectl delete pod webserver
```
Then, recreate the pod with the corrected image:
```bash
kubectl apply -f webserver-pod.yaml
```


2. Additionally, there's a sidecar container named sidecar-container using the ubuntu:latest image.
The sidecar container is configured to run a command that continuously reads the logs from the `httpd-container` and outputs them every 30 seconds. This setup is generally correct, but you should ensure that the log directory `/var/log/httpd` exists and is writable by both containers.
If the sidecar container is not functioning as expected, you can check its logs to see if there are any errors:
```bash
kubectl logs webserver -c sidecar-container
```
cat: /var/log/httpd/access.log: No such file or directory

If the sidecar container is unable to read the logs, it may be because the `httpd-container` has not yet created the log files. You can verify this by checking the logs of the `httpd-container`:
```bash
kubectl logs webserver -c httpd-container
```

If the `httpd-container` is running but not generating logs, you may need to configure the Apache server to log to the specified directory. You can do this by adding a configuration file or modifying the existing one to set the `ErrorLog` and `CustomLog` directives to point to `/var/log/httpd/access.log` and `/var/log/httpd/error.log`, respectively.

To ensure the pod is in the running state and the application is accessible, follow these steps:
1. Correct the image name for the `httpd-container` to `httpd:latest
`.
2. Ensure the log directory `/var/log/httpd` exists and is writable by both containers
3. Configure the Apache server in the `httpd-container` to log to the specified files.
4. Restart the pod to apply the changes.
```bash
kubectl delete pod webserver
kubectl apply -f webserver-pod.yaml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webserver

    app: web-app

        command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do cat /var/log/httpd/access.log /var/log/httpd/error.log; sleep 30; done"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
        mountPath: /var/log/httpd
    volumes:
    - name: shared-logs
      emptyDir: {}
```bash
kubectl apply -f webserver-pod.yaml
```
or 
```bash
kubectl create -f - <<EOF

      - name: shared-logs
        mountPath: /var/log/httpd
  volumes:
  - name: shared-logs
    emptyDir: {}

```
 
 launch the pod and verify its status:
```bash
kubectl get pods webserver
```
```bash
kubectl describe pod webserver
```
```bash
